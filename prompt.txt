- These notes must fully substitute the paper.
- Be precise, structured, and detailed — no fluff.
- Be faithful to the paper’s claims (do not invent content).
- Highlight important concepts, definitions, frameworks, and arguments.
- Use clear section headers, bullet points, tables, and callout boxes.

- Explain tradeoffs and design choices

### 6. Evaluation / Evidence
- How claims are validated
- What evidence is used
- Strengths and limitations of the evaluation
- Explicitly link claims → evidence

### 7. Examples / Case Studies (if present)
For each example:
- Problem context
- Artifact / idea applied
- Evaluation method
- Key takeaway

### 8. Limitations, Challenges, Open Issues
- What the authors explicitly admit
- Structural or methodological limitations
- Where future work is needed

### 9. Practical Takeaways / Study Checklist
- Bullet list I can memorize
- Use this to:
  - Review for exams
  - Evaluate other papers
  - Design my own research

### 10. Figures & Tables Index (FINAL SECTION)
For each figure/table:
- Paper page number
- PDF page number
- Short description of what it represents
- Credits if the paper cites another source

### 11. Credits & Citation
- Full paper citation
- Any cited figure credits
- Statement that notes are a study companion

────────────────────────────────
IMAGE HANDLING (VERY IMPORTANT)
────────────────────────────────
- DO NOT embed actual images.
- Insert a clearly labeled “Image Slot” for every figure/table.
- The explanation MUST be immediately next to the image slot.
- Include:
  - Figure/Table number
  - Title
  - What it means (interpretation, not caption repetition)
  - Page references so I can screenshot manually

────────────────────────────────
STYLE REQUIREMENTS
────────────────────────────────
- Clear academic tone
- No marketing language
- No excessive emojis
- Use callout boxes for:
  - Key insights
  - Exam tips
  - “Say this in your own words” summaries
- Prefer structured clarity over verbosity

────────────────────────────────
OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS
────────────────────────────────
- Output ONLY the final HTML (no explanation).

Now generate the complete HTML notes for the given paper.

The paper is attached, use it as the sole source.
